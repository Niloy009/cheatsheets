Hello, I am Niloy Saha Roy, who is learning BASH now
Its fun to learn new things.

Some useful commands:
```bash

pwd 			# print working directory

ls  			# print the file/dir names on that directory

ls -F 			# -F flag tells what the things insde that dir (dir or files)

cd docs			# change directory to docs

touch new_file.txt	# create a file

mkdir new_dir		# create a new directory

rm file.txt		# delete a file

rm -r new_dir		# delete a directory

mv old_name.txt new_name.txt 	# change the file name

cp file_1.txt file_2.txt 	# copy the content of file_1 to file_2

cp -r dir_1 dir_2 		# copy directory
```

# When we want to use nano editor, we have to follow some general steps as follows:
```bash
# Step 1
nano filename.txt         # open nano editor and create a file filename.txt
```
### Step 2    ->  Then write whatever we need

### Step 3 
- Press `Ctrl + O`  to save our work

### Step 4 
- Press `Enter`  to accept the change

### Step 5 
- Press `Ctrl + X`  to exit nano editor and return to shell

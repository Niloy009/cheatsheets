Hello, I am Niloy Saha Roy, who is learning BASH now
Its fun to learn new things.

Some useful commands:
```bash

pwd 			# print working directory

ls  			# print the file/dir names on that directory

ls -F 			# -F flag tells what the things insde that dir (dir or files)

cd docs			# change directory to docs

touch new_file.txt	# create a file

mkdir new_dir		# create a new directory

rm file.txt		# delete a file

rm -r new_dir		# delete a directory
```



when we want to use nano editor, we have to follow some general steps as follows:
1. nano filename.txt         # open nano editor and create a file filename.txt
2. Then write whatever we need 
3. Press "Control + O"         # to save our work
4. Press "Enter"               # to accept the change
5. Press "Control + X"         # to exit nano editor and return to shell
